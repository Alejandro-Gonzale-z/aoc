# Advent Of Code 2024 in Rust  

## Purpose
As a way to learn the programming language Rust, I will be attempting to complete advent of code (I'm only about a month late). 
I have been reading one of the many rust textbooks, and found it is not enough to just read through the code snippets and takes some notes on interesting new concepts (such as match expressions). 
In order to properly learn the language and become comfortable with it I need to solve problems!
